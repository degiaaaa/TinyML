# TinyML Kurs

Welcome to the course "TinyML: Introduction to Machine Learning for Embedded Systems". In this online course we will take an in-depth look at the emerging technology of TinyML and how it can be used in embedded systems. During the course, we will take an in-depth look at why TinyML is important and how it can be used to make devices smarter.

No specific prior knowledge of embedded programming or machine learning is required to attend the course. However, if there are gaps in knowledge, course participants can catch up on the necessary knowledge autodidactically in the course modules. The modules are structured to provide a sound introduction to the fundamentals of embedded programming and machine learning to ensure a solid understanding of the concepts.

Another advantage of the course is that it is entirely online, which allows students to participate from anywhere in the world. The online course also offers flexible scheduling to meet the different needs of the participants.

Various elements are offered in the course to support and facilitate the learning process. These include "readings", in which the course participants read a script on the respective topic and can thus acquire the necessary background knowledge. There are also "programming tasks" where the course participants have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in practice by programming themselves. Finally, there are "quizzes" in which the acquired knowledge is checked to ensure that the participants have achieved the learning objectives.

Overall, the course "TinyML: Introduction to Machine Learning for Embedded Systems" offers an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge in the field of TinyML technology. Participants will be able to understand the concepts and technologies of TinyML and use them effectively in embedded systems.
